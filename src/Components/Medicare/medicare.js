            These plans offer an alternative way to get your Original Medicare,
            Part A and Part B, benefits. Unlike Original Medicare, Medicare
            Advantage and DSNP plans may also include prescription drug coverage
            (Part D) and additional benefits, like vision, dental, hearing
            coverage, over-the-counter health products, transportation and a
            fitness benefit.
          </Plan>
          <Plan title="Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage" subtitle="Part D">
            You can enroll in a stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that
            can complement your existing Original Medicare (Part A and Part B)
            coverage. These plans cover a formulary of brand and generic
            medications.
          </Plan>
          <Plan title="Medicare Supplement Plans" subtitle="Medigap">
            These policies are sold by private insurance companies to help pay
            some of the healthcare costs that Original Medicare (Parts A and B)
            doesn't cover. These plans may offer benefits such as assistance
            with deductibles, premiums, and copayment/ coinsurance, as well as
            emergency foreign travel coverage.
          </Plan>
          <Plan title="Need Medicare Coverage?">
            Unified Health works with consumers to find affordable Medicare
            coverage that meets their healthcare needs. Unified Healthâ€™s
